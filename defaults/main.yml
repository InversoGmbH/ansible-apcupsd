  ### DEVICE CONFIGURATION
  # ---------------------------------------

  # Defines the type of cable connecting the UPS to your computer.
  #
  # Possible generic choices for <cable> are:
  #     simple, smart, ether, usb
  #
  #   Or a specific cable model number may be used:
  #     940-0119A, 940-0127A, 940-0128A, 940-0020B,
  #     940-0020C, 940-0023A, 940-0024B, 940-0024C,
  #     940-1524C, 940-0024G, 940-0095A, 940-0095B,
  #     940-0095C, 940-0625A, M-04-02-2000
  upscable: usb

  # To get apcupsd to work, in addition to defining the cable
  # above, you must also define a UPSTYPE, which corresponds to
  # the type of UPS you have (see the Description for more details).
  # You must also specify a DEVICE, sometimes referred to as a port.
  # For USB UPSes, please leave the DEVICE directive blank. For
  # other UPS types, you must specify an appropriate port or address.
  #
  # UPSTYPE   DEVICE           Description
  # apcsmart  /dev/tty**       Newer serial character device, appropriate for
  #                            SmartUPS models using a serial cable (not USB).
  #
  # usb       <BLANK>          Most new UPSes are USB. A blank DEVICE
  #                            setting enables autodetection, which is
  #                            the best choice for most installations.
  #
  # net       hostname:port    Network link to a master apcupsd through apcupsd's
  #                            Network Information Server. This is used if the
  #                            UPS powering your computer is connected to a
  #                            different computer for monitoring.
  #
  # snmp      hostname:port:vendor:community
  #                            SNMP network link to an SNMP-enabled UPS device.
  #                            Hostname is the ip address or hostname of the UPS
  #                            on the network. Vendor can be can be "APC" or
  #                            "APC_NOTRAP". "APC_NOTRAP" will disable SNMP trap
  #                            catching; you usually want "APC". Port is usually
  #                            161. Community is usually "private".
  #
  # netsnmp   hostname:port:vendor:community
  #                            OBSOLETE
  #                            Same as SNMP above but requires use of the
  #                            net-snmp library. Unless you have a specific need
  #                            for this old driver, you should use 'snmp' instead.
  #
  # dumb      /dev/tty**       Old serial character device for use with
  #                            simple-signaling UPSes.
  #
  # pcnet     ipaddr:username:passphrase:port
  #                            PowerChute Network Shutdown protocol which can be
  #                            used as an alternative to SNMP with the AP9617
  #                            family of smart slot cards. ipaddr is the IP
  #                            address of the UPS management card. username and
  #                            passphrase are the credentials for which the card
  #                            has been configured. port is the port number on
  #                            which to listen for messages from the UPS, normally
  #                            3052. If this parameter is empty or missing, the
  #                            default of 3052 will be used.
  #
  # modbus    /dev/tty**       Serial device for use with newest SmartUPS models
  #                            supporting the MODBUS protocol.
  upstype: usb
  device:

  # Interval (in seconds) at which apcupsd polls the UPS for status. This
  # setting applies both to directly-attached UPSes (UPSTYPE apcsmart, usb,
  # dumb) and networked UPSes (UPSTYPE net, snmp).
